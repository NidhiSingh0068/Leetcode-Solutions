Ques: Which is better recursion or iteration in Python?
Ans: Since Python does not store anything about previous iteration steps, iteration is quite faster and memory-efficient than recursion.
     With regard to time complexity, recursive and iterative methods both will give you O(log n) time complexity, with regard to input size,
     provided you implement correct binary search logic.
     Focusing on space complexity, the iterative approach is more efficient since we are allocating a constant amount O(1) of space for 
     the function call and constant space for variable allocations, while the recursive approach takes O(log n) space.
